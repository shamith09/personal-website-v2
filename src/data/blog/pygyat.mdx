PyGyat is a programming language that brings a fresh perspective to Python by replacing traditional keywords with Gen Alpha slang. This project showcases both technical expertise in language design and a creative approach to making programming more engaging.

The language maintains Python's functionality while introducing a unique syntax that makes coding more approachable and fun for younger generations. Key features include custom lexer and parser implementation, full Python compatibility, and an innovative approach to syntax design.
